        <h3>Talk Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Evaluating Medical AI: From Benchmarks to Bedside</strong></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            How do we know if a medical AI system actually works? In this talk, I will share lessons from a decade of
            building evaluation frameworks for clinical AI—and the surprising gaps between benchmark performance and
            real-world impact.
            <br><br>
            I will discuss CheXpert, a chest X-ray benchmark that forced the field to confront uncertainty: radiologists
            often disagree, and we designed labels to capture this ambiguity rather than hide it. I will introduce
            ReXrank, the first public leaderboard for AI-generated radiology reports, which tests whether models
            generalize across 10,000 studies from diverse hospital systems. I will also present CRAFT-MD, which moves
            beyond static test sets to evaluate large language models through simulated doctor–patient conversations—
            revealing that models acing medical board exams often fail in realistic clinical dialogue.
            <br><br>
            The most surprising lesson came from studying what happens after the benchmark. In large-scale experiments
            with over 140 radiologists, we found that AI assistance often fails to improve clinical decisions—not because
            the AI is wrong, but because of systematic biases in how humans incorporate AI predictions. This has led us
            to rethink the “AI assistant” paradigm entirely, proposing instead clear role separation where AI and
            clinicians each own different parts of the workflow.
            <br><br>
            I will close with reflections on what makes a benchmark actually useful for driving progress in high-stakes
            domains, and where evaluation needs to go next.

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
            Pranav Rajpurkar is a computer scientist and Associate Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard
            University, and co-founder of a2z Radiology AI. He received his bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD degrees in
            computer science from Stanford University, where he pioneered early methods for AI in medical imaging.
            <br><br>
            At Harvard, he leads the Rajpurkar Lab, developing “AI doctors”—generalist medical AI systems that integrate
            multimodal data and reason across them like physicians. His research spans multimodal generative models,
            medical foundation models, and multi-agent architectures for reliable clinical AI.
            <br><br>
            He has published over 160 papers with more than 46,000 citations, including work in Nature, Nature Medicine,
            Cell, and The Lancet, and co-authored the New York Times essay “The Robot Doctor Will See You Now.” He has
            been recognized by Forbes 30 Under 30, MIT Technology Review’s Innovators Under 35, and Nature Medicine’s
            To Watch, and has taught over 84,000 students worldwide.
