        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Benchmarking AI and the role of technical standards in growing AI markets</strong></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            This lecture describes the importance of benchmarks and other technical standards for growing AI markets,
            with a focus on benchmarks and standards developed by the non-profit MLCommons Association. It covers the
            MLPerf hardware benchmarks, AILuminate reliability benchmarks, MedPerf federated evaluation framework, and
            the Croissant data standard.
        </p>

        <p>
            For each benchmark or technical standard, the lecture provides the industry context behind its creation,
            a technical overview, forward development challenges, and its utility across academic research, large-scale
            industry deployments, and startups.
        </p>
