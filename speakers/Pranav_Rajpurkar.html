        <h3>Talk Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Evaluating Medical AI: From Benchmarks to Bedside</strong></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            How do we know if a medical AI system actually works? In this talk, I will share lessons from a decade of
            building evaluation frameworks for clinical AI—and the surprising gaps between benchmark performance and
            real-world impact.
            <br><br>
            I will discuss CheXpert, a chest X-ray benchmark that forced the field to confront uncertainty: radiologists
            often disagree, and we designed labels to capture this ambiguity rather than hide it. I will introduce
            ReXrank, the first public leaderboard for AI-generated radiology reports, which tests whether models
            generalize across 10,000 studies from diverse hospital systems. I will also present CRAFT-MD, which moves
            beyond static test sets to evaluate large language models through simulated doctor–patient conversations—
            revealing that models acing medical board exams often fail in realistic clinical dialogue.
            <br><br>
            The most surprising lesson came from studying what happens after the benchmark. In large-scale experiments
            with over 140 radiologists, we found that AI assistance often fails to improve clinical decisions—not because
            the AI is wrong, but because of systematic biases in how humans incorporate AI predictions. This has led us
            to rethink the “AI assistant” paradigm entirely, proposing instead clear role separation where AI and
            clinicians each own different parts of the workflow.
            <br><br>
            I will close with reflections on what makes a benchmark actually useful for driving progress in high-stakes
            domains, and where evaluation needs to go next.
        </p>

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
            Pranav Rajpurkar is a computer scientist, Associate Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard University,
            and co-founder of <a href="https://a2zradiology.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a2z Radiology AI</a>.
            He received his bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD degrees in computer science from Stanford University, where he
            pioneered early methods for AI in medical imaging.
            <br><br>
            At Harvard, he leads the <a href="https://www.rajpurkarlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rajpurkar Lab</a>,
            developing “AI doctors”—generalist medical AI systems that integrate multimodal data (clinical text, images,
            signals) and reason across them like physicians. His research introduces multimodal generative AI models,
            foundation models for medicine, and coordinated multi-agent architectures designed to improve reliability and
            interpretability in clinical contexts. At a2z Radiology AI, he helped develop the first multi-finding
            abdomen–pelvis CT triage AI commercially available in the US.
            <br><br>
            Rajpurkar has published over 160 papers with more than 46,000 citations, including work in
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03449-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nature Medicine</a>,
            <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00594-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cell</a>,
            and
            <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02824-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lancet</a>,
            helping define modern medical AI paradigms. He co-authored
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ai-doctors-medicine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Robot Doctor Will See You Now”</a>
            in <em>The New York Times</em> with Eric Topol, rethinking human–AI collaboration in healthcare.
