        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery, with Examples in Fluid Mechanics</strong></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            This work will discuss several key challenges and opportunities in the use of machine learning
            for nonlinear system identification. In particular, I will describe how machine learning may be
            used to develop accurate and efficient nonlinear dynamical systems models for complex natural
            and engineered systems. I will emphasize the need for interpretable and generalizable
            data-driven models, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm,
            which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy,
            avoiding overfitting. I will also introduce several key benchmark problems in dynamical systems
            and fluid dynamics that provide a diversity of metrics to assess modern system identification
            techniques. Because fluid dynamics is central to transportation, health, and defense systems,
            we will emphasize the importance of machine learning solutions that are interpretable,
            explainable, generalizable, and that respect known physics.
