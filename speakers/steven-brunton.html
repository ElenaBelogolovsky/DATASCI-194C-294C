        <h3>Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery, with Examples in Fluid Mechanics</strong></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            This work will discuss several key challenges and opportunities in using machine learning
            for nonlinear system identification. In particular, I will describe how machine learning may be
            used to develop accurate and efficient nonlinear dynamical systems models for complex natural
            and engineered systems. I will emphasize the need for interpretable and generalizable
            data-driven models, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm,
            which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy,
            avoiding overfitting.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will also introduce several key benchmark problems in dynamical systems and fluid dynamics
            that provide diverse metrics to assess modern system identification techniques. Because fluid
            dynamics is central to transportation, health, and defense systems, we will emphasize the need
            for machine learning solutions that are interpretable, explainable, generalizable, and that
            respect known physics.
