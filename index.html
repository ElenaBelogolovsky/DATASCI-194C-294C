                <p>*** This course examines the **Challenge Problems Paradigm (CPP)** and its broader role in empirical machine learning and related fields. At the heart of CPP is the **Common Task Framework (CTF)**—a structured methodology that has driven major breakthroughs, including the Netflix Prize and AlphaFold, which was recognized with the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its groundbreaking contributions to protein structure prediction.</p>
                
                <p>CTF consists of a publicly available training dataset, a collaborative competition model, and an objective scoring referee that evaluates performance against a sequestered test set.</p>
                
                <p>We will explore how this framework, popularized by platforms like Kaggle, CodaLab, and Nightingale Open Science, fosters rapid innovation through accessible collaboration, transparent benchmarks, rapid feedback loops, and outcome-driven reasoning. Case studies from computer vision, natural language processing, empirical finance, and computational sciences will illustrate its widespread impact.</p>
                
                <p>We will examine evidence that CTF itself serves as a **"secret sauce" of data science**, driving technological advancements and breakthrough innovations. Additionally, we will discuss critical concerns, including dataset biases, reproducibility issues, and overfitting to benchmarks.</p>
